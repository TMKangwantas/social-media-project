# SocialMediaProject

This is my first project that I've made using Angular. 
I took a course on Udemy and applied what I learned there to create this project.

It functions in a similar manner to a very basic version of Facebook: 
 - Users can create posts with option for pictures (via links from the web)
 - Users can like and comment on posts
 - Users can search for and view other users' profiles 
 - The difference here is that everyone is friends with one another
 
The database that I use to support this application is Google's Firebase.
